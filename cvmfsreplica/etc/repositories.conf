# DESCRIPTION:
#
#     configuration file, repository by repository,
#     for the replica daemon
# 
# VARIABLES:
#
#     enabled
#         True or False
#
#     repositoryname
#         name of the repository to be replicated.
#         Matches /cvmfs/<repository>/
#
#     interval 
#         time, in seconds, between replication cycles
#
#     ntrials 
#         number of times to try replicating the repository
#         in case of failures
#
#     timeout
#         number of seconds until timing out the replication
#         process. 
#         Use with caution, as the replication can naturally
#         take a long time.
#         Optional.
#
#     =====================================================
#                  PLUGINS 
#     =====================================================
#
#     There are several types of plugins, optional, that 
#     can be used to perform different type of actions.
#     Some of these plugins may have their own set of 
#     custom attributes. 
#     Nomenclature to set these attributes is always like this
#
#         <type_of_plugin>.<plugin_name>.<attribute>
#
#     where strings are always lower case.
#
#     There are currently 3 types of plugins, described below:
#         -- Acceptance plugins
#         -- Report plugins
#         -- Post plugins
#
#     =====================================================
#
#     reportplugins
#         list of plugins to notify/report/alert/... 
#         when something goes wrong 
#         Available plugins:
#
#             Email
#                 sends an email no notify failures   
#
#     report.email.admin_email
#         email address to send messages 
#         when replication fails
#         multiple addresses can be set split by comma
#
#     report.email.smtp_server
#         email server
#
#     =====================================================
#
#     acceptanceplugins
#         list of plugins to decide if the replications should
#         actually be attempted or not
#         Avaialable plugins:
#
#            Updatedserver 
#                checks if the server was updated after
#                last replication attempt
#
#            Diskspace
#                checks if there is enough disk space
#                for the SPOOL and STORAGE directories 
#
#     diskspace.spool_size
#        minimum size needed for the SPOOL directory, in bytes
#
#     diskspace.storage_size
#        minimum size needed for the STORAGE directory, in bytes
#
#     diskspace.should_abort
#        specifies is the thread for that repository should be
#        stopped in case the diskspace test fails. 
#        Values=True|False
#        Default is True
#
#     -----------------------------------------------------
#
#     The acceptance plugins can also, when they fail, 
#     invoke report plugins. 
#
#     The nomenclature to set the report plugins for this case
#     is similar to the general case, but adding string
#
#        "acceptance.<name_of_the_acceptance_plugin>."
#
#     at the beginning of the option name.
#     For example, to allow acceptance plugin "Diskspace"
#     to notify failures via email:
#
#         acceptance.diskspace.reportplugins = Email
#         acceptance.diskspace.report.email.admin_email = neo@matrix.net
#         acceptance.diskspace.report.email.smtp_server = my.email.server 
#
#     =====================================================
#
#     postplugins
#        list of plugins to run after the replication was done 
#        (or attempted). 
#        Useful, for example, to clean up files.
#        Avaialable plugins:
#
#            Cleanup
#                cleans some files
#
